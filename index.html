          <p class="post">
              When writing a webpage in HTML, it is vital to understand the "Box Model". The fancy name and the aura of mystery that surround this concept may make the idea seem unapproachable at first, but with a little bit of straight talk and simple visualization, you'll be on your way to working with this core concept in no time.

          <p class="post">
              Think of the very edge of your webpage as a large rectangular canvas. Everything you see on your webpage must go on the canvas, and everything that makes it onto the final painting - be it text, photos, icons, etc. - everything is contained within smaller rectangles that fit on the canvas. These smaller boxes can hug the very edes of the text and may be invisible, but even when you can't see them, trust me - they're there. 
          </p>
          <p class="post">
              Whether you can see these rectangles (whether they have a color or an outline), is dependent on how you define these boxes, and there are really only three things that you need to worry about defining when you're first starting out: Margin, Border, and Padding. Let's go back to our canvas now and smack in the middle, we're going to start painting: to be precise, I want you to paint an image of a framed photograph. What are the different things you'll need to paint? Obviously, you'll need to paint the frame - will it be a thick frame? What color will the frame be? We will also need to paint the photo: will it be one of those frames where there is a plain white buffer inside the frame between the frame and the photo? Will the photo go to the edges of the frame?
          </p>
          <p class="post">
              Objects inside the Box Model are just like that: the objects in your webpage are all just painting of framed objects (a moment ago that object was a photograph, but it could also be text, a paragraph of text, a movie, viewer, etc.). The only difference is that in HTML we don't call the frames "frames", we call them "borders"; and we don't call that buffer zone between the frame and the object it frames a "buffer", we call it "Padding". You'll be wondering about that last term I haven't mentioned, "Margin", and this is essentially the same idea as padding, except whereas padding is defined as the space between the frame and what is inside the frame, "margins" are just the space between the edges of the frame and anything else that is painted on the larger canvas. We could leave 5 inches between the border (or the frame) and everything else on the canvas, and that would be us defining "margin" as "5 inches". Although we don't use inches to meaure space, we use screen pixels, which is written as "px".
          </p>
          <p class="post">
              Now remember - all the borders (or all the frames) must be in the shape of a rectangle. And, as you'll remember, every rectangle has four sides. Now, since webpages are only viewed one way (or at least they normally aren't viewed upside down), we define those four sides very sensibly: top, right, bottom, and left - and we always talk about them in that order. We can define them all at once (e.g. margin: 5px) or define them each individually (e.g border-left: 20px).
          </p>

          <p class="post">
            This is a real picture frame. Do you see the frame? That's our "Border" - we can make it as thick or thin as we want; we can make it dashed or solid; we can make it any color in the spectrum of light. Do you see the off-white buffer? That's our "Padding" - again, we can make it as thick or thin as we want (it can be 0px or 100px). That white space in the middle would be our object, but we'll leave that discussion for a different time. Do you see the space between the edge of the border and the text above it? That's our margin - and here again, we can make it as large are small as we want. Suffice it to say, that everything on your webpage - everything - has one of these, whether you see it or not! Here are a few more examples, and the code that defines each:
          </p>
          <img id="img_frame" src="../3boxes.png" alt="">
          <p class="post">
            Let's start with Box 1. The black "border" is 10px thick on all sides. You can see that there's no space between the border and the yellow contents, which means that the padding is 0px all the way around. But what about the margin? The margin between the top of the Box 1 object box is much larger than the margin on the right side, that is, the margin separating Box 1 from Box 2. Box 2's black border is much thicker (30px to be exact) and it has a large white padding space (50px) between the border and the yellow object. Box 3 is almost the same as Box 2, but the big difference is that margins - the margin between the edge of the Box 3 frame and the other boxes is much larger than that between Box 1 and Box 2. Further the margin between the Box 3 frame and this paragraph is much larger than between the last paragraph and Box 2.

          <p class="post">
              The Shanghai Metro is the world’s largest metro system, comprised of 270 trains (1,490 cars) servicing 282 stations across 420km (260mi) of track. Each day, 6.5mn passengers (equivalent to the combined populations of Los Angeles and Chicago) walk into 600 Metro entrances and pay RMB20mn (US$3.2mn) to pass through 1,700 ticket gates, traverse 35 interchanges, and board 12 subway lines.
          </p>
          <p class="post">

              At 0610 China Standard Time (CST), I am among them, awaiting the Line 9 eastbound express from Dapuqiao to the Lujiazui financial district. Backlit advertisements smile from the walls and ceilings are hung with televisions blaring Propaganda Department-approved news stories. As a train arrives and the doors open, the queue surges forward. Forced past disembarking passengers, I squeeze in amongst the crush and brace as the doors close and the train jolts forward. My fellow sardines are an assorted crowd: some sleep, some stare out windows, and others make idle conversation. A majority of the passengers stare into glowing cellphones: they watch American sitcoms, Korean soap-operas, and Japanese anime; they play videogames, cut fruit with katanas, slingshot birds, and drive racecars; they post on Weibo, flirt on Momo, and text on WeChat.
          </p>
          <p class="post">

              As myriad distractions inundate the train car, I am struck by how willingly passengers abandon the train’s reality and ride abstract non-sequiturs to their destinations. For my part, the 2,700 seconds between my apartment and office constitutes 5% of my workday: I check the day’s schedule, index my priorities, peruse overnight market news, reply to client requests, and email my mother.

              Observing my fellow passengers, I am often reminded of a Buddhist teaching on meditation:
          </p>
          <p class="post">

              “For the ordinary man, whose mind is a checkerboard of crisscrossing reflections, opinions and prejudices, bare attention is virtually impossible. His life is thus centered not in reality itself, but in his ideas of it.”
          </p>
          <p class="post">

              - Roshi Philip Kapleau, The Three Pillars of Zen
          </p>
          <p class="post">

              What matters most to me is mindfulness of the present moment – I lament minutes lost in frivolous pursuits or squandered on meaningless distractions. Time is in short supply, and every moment is an opportunity warranting attention.
          </p>
          <p class="post">

              By 0700 CST, I am in the office and 7% into my workday. When maintenance priorities (editing products, updating data, and drafting commentary) are complete, I focus my attention on the more expansive challenge of China macroeconomics. My approach to quantitative analysis of the world’s second largest economy (2011 GDP: US$7.3trn) involves an immense volume of data (8.6GB) drawn from hundreds of sources (statistics bureaus, market information services, commodity traders, purchasing managers, etc.) illustrating a seemingly endless number of variables (bilateral trade flows, investment volumes, consumer price indices, currency movements, commodity prices, interbank offering rates, loan volumes, etc.). Mindfulness affords me the mental strength and clarity of thought required to envision the behavior, interactions, and implications of these variables; it defines my purpose when collating legions of numbers into informative models and anchors my assumptions when conducting scenario analyses.
          </p>
          <p class="post">

              At 2000 CST, just 50,400 moments after it began, my workday is done and I am again aboard the Shanghai Metro. My commute home is reserved for calling or corresponding with my girlfriend, Anya, my cherished family (2 parents, 2 sisters, 1 grandmother, 2 godchildren, 25 cousins, 8 uncles, 8 aunts) and close friends (former colleagues, college roommates, high school classmates). Christenings, birthdays, graduations, and weddings are all celebrated and enjoyed in the company of my fellow commuters. As the second-eldest of my cousins, I find college counseling, internship advice, interview preparation, and career guidance are increasingly outsourced to my China mobile. Mindfulness enables me to appreciate the truly important relationships and events in my life – even when they occur 17 time zones away – and helps me address the variables of highest import in my personal life.
          </p>
          <p class="post">

              My day is no more demanding than many others, but mindfulness helps me appreciate each moment in my life, both individually and in aggregate. These moments have taught me the value of my own mind and the value of trusting my own thoughts and actions. Adam Smith was right:
          </p>
          <p class="post">

              “The advantage which is gained by saving the time commonly lost in passing from one sort of work to another, is much greater than we should at first view be apt to imagine it.”
          </p>

          <p class="post">
              The mindfulness techniques touched upon this week were especially interesting. I have been a disciple of the 'Miracle of Mindfulness' for several years now, and I find effective employment of mind-management leads to high quality work and minimizes my stress levels. Mindfulness also gives me the confidence that when tackling an especially difficult task, I am not only acheiving the nominal goal of compeleting the task, but also capturing the real benefit of focusing my mind on a difficult challenge and - when the challenge is overcome - expanding both my ability and my self-confidence in my mind's ability to grow and improve.
          </p>
          <p class="post">
              Mindfulness is a strange creature: like a Mandelbrot set, there are universes within universes on until infinity. The catalyst for my initial foray into mindfulness was my recognition that, "There aren't enough hours in the day." I actually found myself half-jokingly telling a manager this exact thing once in an annual review. I've learned that our minds don't come with 'factory-settings' that can't be changed; they are amazing tools, but they require constant training and attention. I really find it fascinating that so few of us spend time thinking about thinking.
          </p>
          <p class="post">
              Preparation is certainly the first part of my plan for Phase 0; that includes not just scheduling, but also utilizing my 'free-time' to expand my hacking ability beyond those skills explicity addressed in the Phase 0 curriculum. Beyond this, I suppose my time management plan can be summarized in two words: focus and attention.

              Version control is system of recording and tracking changes to document or repository of documents. It enables multiple parties to collaborate on the development of a single document or repo without fear that different parties will create incompatible branches of the target document.
          </p>
          <p class="post">
              Git is a version control system enabling software engineers and other parties to collaborate on a single distributed document (e.g. code base, text document) without fear that changes will be lost in the process of swapping versions among project collaborators. Git tracks changes (both the changes themselves and the author of the changes) and ensures all involved parties are both informed of changes and operating on the most current version of a document. There are redundancies to ensure that any changes made to a master file are legitimate (i.e. pull requests), and functionality for reverting to a previous version of document.
          </p>
          <p class="post">
              Github is remote repository of the git version control system which enables users in disparate locations to collaborate on projects using Git. User profiles, users public repositories, and user activity are available for viewing by the GitHub community.
          </p>
          <p class="post">
              Developers use version control for a number of reasons:
              1) To prevent development of incompatible branches of the target document or code
              2) To track changes and enable retroactive assessment of changes
              3) To collaborate with numerous involved parties in potentially widely dispersed geographic locations
