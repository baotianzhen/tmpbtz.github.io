          <h1 class="subject" id="c6-stereotype-threat">Stereotype Threat</h1>      
          <p class="post">
            Stereotype threat is the experience of feeling at risk of confirming a stereotype about one's social group.  This can be an debilitating mental condition - the constant fear of confirming others' negative perceptions of your ability can lead to severe self doubt, lack of confidence, lack of motivation, and ultimately to fulfillment of the expectation that started the whole sorry downward spiral. I have witnessed the way in which our awareness of stereotypes about one of our social groups (whether our perception of the prescence of these stereotypes is real or imagined), can severly and negatively impact the way people behave; causing significant mental anguish and preventing a person from a happy life. 
          </p>
          <p class="post">
            I have been fortunate in that I have avoided the debilitating effects of stereotype threat - whether by virtue of the quality of compnay I have kept, or, perhaps through obliviousness. That this psychologicla condition has had a significant impact on my mental state is not to say that I have not experienced it. Indeed, as a 6'4'' American roaming the streets of China for five years, I was very well aware of the stereotypes I was expected to fulfill: loud, brash, uncivilized. When I first arrived in northern China in 2007, I was constantly aware of the stares I received - the outer Mongolian plains of Heilongjiang province are not a main thoroughfare for "laowai" (foreigners), but no matter where you live - no matter who you are - you consume American television and Hollywood movies; this was expecially true in intellectual property-free circa-2007 China (where a blu-ray rip off of the most recent Hollywood blockbuster can be purchased for $1). And in movies, Americans are a loud and violent people: it seems there's an average of one explosion for every minute of American cinematic art; guns are constantly firing; and Old Glory is held up to be the ultimate symbol for freedom and happiness.  This strikes many people as overy American-centric (see Vladimir Putin), and reality televison certainly hasn't done much to assuage the world's concerns that Americans are a lot of hayseeds with guns (not to mention nukes). The American invasion of Iraq was still fresh in the minds of many Chinese (more than a few approached me demanding an apology for the "arrogance" of my nation's government and military). 
          </p>
          <p class="post">
            So, quietly riding a train across China with a bit of newly minted Mandarin language ability, I was keenly aware of what people expected of me - I could feel the sterotypes as if they hung around my neck. Yet, the more I traveled, the lighter that became - the more I interacted with people, the more conversations I had, the more I realized that my perception of their sterotypes had been spot on. Once people discover you belong to a certain class, they make the most ridiculous associations between you and that class; and that's where the weight of the stereotypes disappeared, right when I saw the ridiculousness of it. And so I went from fearing the American stereotype to looking forward to it - it became a game for me to manuver myself to the perfect place to overturn that sterotype (a well-placed word or two in Mandarin can turn heads faster than a gunshot). Stereotypes are judgement without understanding - it's a type of ignorance that forms of other people trying to make sense of a world they don't care enough to understand properly, so they fill in the gaps in their understanding with the easiest-to-grasp explanation. As I mentioned at the outset - I don't believe I've endured a truly pernicious form of stereotype threat, but in my experience teh best response to this is 1) laugh if you can and 2) forget about it: focus on things you can control and what really matters to you. Someone else's ignorance is their problem, not yours.

          <h1 class="subject" id="t6-oop-concepts">The Real World: Object-Oriented Programming</h1>      
          <p class="post">
            The idea of the "object" is self-evidently the most fundamentally important concepts for programmers coding in object-oriented languages like Ruby. This "object-orientation" may at first brush seem to be an impenetrable and esoteric idea, but the core concept here is easily grasped: object-orientation is not simply an approach to programming, but a method for describing real things in the real world. Let us take, as an example, the real-world idea of traded tangible objects - in particular, we will consider exports from the United States to the rest of the world (RoW). Further, as the large majority of trade between the United States and RoW is conducted in "commodities" (like shovels, airplane engines, and beef) as opposed to "services" (like haircuts or tax accounting), let us strictly consider US-RoW commodity exports.
          </p>
          <p class="post">
            In any given year, the United States economy produces billions of individual objects (or "commodities") for export to countries across the world, and the responsibility for tracking the volume, cost, and timing of these shipments falls to the Foreign Trade Division of the United States Census Bureau (FTD). For logistical and other reasons, however, the FTD does not track or release numbers for the export of specific individual products (e.g. certain watches made by a certain company). That role is filled by the individual producer of those individual products, and this is well and right: the United States Census bureau has has no interest in knowing exactly how many pounds of a beef a certain farm ships to Brazil (the IRS, on the other hand, is very interested - but they nonetheless rely on business owners to keep and report these statistics). The purpose of the FTD division is to determine the volume of trade in classes of products and classes of industry - not how many blue watches were sold vs. red watches; that level of granularity and detail is unnecessary. Indeed, the FTD has clearly defined the level of granularity required of exporters: that body of definitions is called the Standard International Trade Classification System (SITC). SITC is a taxonomy of interantionally tradeable commodities, and it works exactly the way the system of Biology you likely learned in middle school (i.e. Kingdom --> Phylum --> Class --> Order --> etc.) worked. Each object at the bottom of either of these hierarchies ('5-digit' commodities in our SITC example; the species 'female hummingbirds' in the biology case) is a subclass of one of the objects in the level above. So, "bourbon" exported to Australia from the United States falls into five different classes at five different class-levels: 1 Beverages & Tobacco --> 1.1 Beverages --> 1.1.2 Alcoholic beverages --> 1.1.2.4 Spirits ---> 1.1.2.4.1 Whiskey (there is no sub-classification for 'Whisky' in SITC). 
          </p>
          <p class="post">
            The sense in categorizing internationally tradeable commodities in this way is likely self-evident - and this intuitive concpetual framework of classification can be applied without much effort to nearly every tangible object in existence. We have classificaion systems for almost everything - ideas, smells, commodities, services - and we even have classification systems for classification systems. In a many ways, these classification systems are the way we make sense of the real world - how we describe things to one another and how we catalog things in our own minds. This is the core idea behind object-oriented programming - it is an attempt to make the beavhior of computer programs mimic the real world.
          </p>
          <p class="post">
            Obviously, a key component of this object-orientation is the "class". Whisky is of the class "Spirits", because its nature is generally explained by the definition of the more general term; in the same way, "spirits" is a sub-class of "Alcoholic beverages", "alcoholic beverages" a sub-class of "beverages", etc. In programming, we call this system of cascading definitions "inheritance": every member of a class shares the exact same class-level definition with every other member of that class. Class definitions are about the state of an object - about an object's core definition.
          </p>  
          <p class="post">
            Objects - in both the real world and in Ruby - are more than their class-definitions or even their specific scientific defintions. They are unique, but almost they oftentitmes share characteristics with other objects: camels and dogs share neither Order, Family, Genus, or Species - yet they both have fur. "Furiness" is characteristic that spans animal classificaton boundaries; "perishable" likewise spans the classification boundaries of SITC. This idea of perishable/non-perishable is one that is not addressed in SITC, yet it is quite obviously an important concept; what to do? There is of course the possibility of creating a new classification system based on similiar concepts (breakable/non-breakable, perishable/non-perishable, edible/non-edible), but this is very likely to be more difficult than the more straightforward definitions of SITC and far less useful. In object-oriented programming, the solution to this kind of conundrum is a 'module'. Modules are much like adjectives in that they describe the object's character, as opposed to classes which define the object's state. 
          </p>
          <p class="post">
            As with adjectives in the real world, modules in object-oriented programming cannot be instantiated - in neither realm can we make "furiness" or "perishable" a tangible object. Modules describe the functionality or character of an object, but they are not necessarily vital to the definition of that object.

          <h1 class="subject" id="c4-bitcoin">Crypto-currency Confidence</h1>
          <p class="post">
            If you ask most information technologists, economists, market strategists, or monetary experts, they'll tell you that while the networks and protocols like Bitcoin (capital 'B') allowing proof and transfer of ownership hold immense promise for lowering the cost of payment systems worldwide, the outlook for the actually units traded (like bitcoins, little 'b') on these systems today is far more uncertain. This is a kind way of saying that while the software and protocol underlying the idea of bitcoins holds long-term value, the idea of bitcoins as a legitimate currency is bankrupt. There are myriad reasons why the skeptics maintain this position, but the core argument is based on the traditional characteristics of successful currencies, namely: 1) wide acceptance as a medium of exchange, and 2) a stable store of value. Successful currencies today ("fiat" currencies) acheive this definiton through extensive government regulation: they are used as legal tender, used to pay taxes, and regulated by central banks who strive to maintain the stability of these currencies' value. Crytocurrencies in their current manifestation have none of these controls - indeed, even the IRS is largely unable to monitor transactions made in today's cryptocurrencies.
          </p>
          <p class="post">
          That last point cuts straight to the first major issue plauging today's cryptocurrencies - the widespread belief that they are somehow anarchist, underhanded, and - at worst - inherently criminal. Crytocurrencies today have a major public relations problem, which in the world of currencies is called a "confidence problem". Confidence problems are kryptonite to fiat currencies, and that potency is not watered-down in the cyberworld. That the cofidence issue is partially based on a myth is largely irrelevant to the point - indeed, while it is true that cryptocurrencies' exchange volume on black markets like Silk Road represent(ed) less than 1% of the global market in cryptocurrencies, the idea of bitcoins as untrustworthy stores of value used most commonly by criminals has pervaded the public perception. So, while the scalability of crytocurrencies is taken as a given, lack of confidence has been a major cause of the reigned-in rate of adoption by consumers. 
          </p>
          <p class="post">
            The issue of whether cryptocurrencies can be a stable store of value is even trickier to solve. One of the fundemental concepts underlying bitcoins is limited supply (the maximum supply is a theoretical 21 milllion bitcoins, each divisible to eight decimal places), which ostensibly should protect bitcoin holders from currency debasement caused by expansion of the money supply and inflation. Yet, the volatility of bitcoins through its five-year history has far exceeded the volatility of successful fiat currencies and gold (the standard-bearer for a 'stable store of value'). The most important issue for most cryptocurrency users, however, is that bitcoins have not been able to acheive stability of exchange with users' own currencies. Indeed, the volatility of bitcoins exchange rates has been extreme: 108% vol vs. a fiat currency norm of less than 15% vol FX rates, and - in the case of the U.S. dollar - ~ 3.0% volatility in the consumer goods purchasing power.

            Software developer, web developer, app developer, investment banker, asset manager, buget officer, compliance officer - pick most any major employment vertical -  the majority of these professions could be generally be summed up thus: professional data manipulator. Obviously, each have their own character, unique challenges, and structures of thought - but at the core they are just that. Indeed, few would could contest that such professionals will spend a majority of their work day "at the computer" -  that's really just a euphemism we've developed for "manipulating data".
          </p>
          <p class="post">
            Of course, the level at which we interact with the data we are manipulating differs radically between professions - the journalist sleuthing on the web and writing in a word processor hardly considers the data underlying those actions; whereas the banker who professionally manipulates spreadsheets is certainly more aware of the data being manipulated (even if unaware that Excel may not be the right tool for every task). The software developer, in the course of...errr, devloping software, is aware of (or at least acknowledges) most levels of data in play that are interpretable by humans.
          </p>
          <p class="post">
            The developer's necessarily more comprehensive understanding of the data in play begins at a very low level - down where actions are represented by integers and alphanumeric codes. There's a lot of data down there, and keeping it straight can be a challenge. How to keep track of all the names, codes and values they represent? Further - how to organize it all?
          </p>
          <p class="post">
            The most fundamental method to organize this information is quite intuitive - separate it into containers. Apples with the apples and oranges with the oranges; put the letters of the alphabet in the 'alphabet container', and the numeric codes for the world's airports in the 'airport code container'. 
          </p>
          <p class="post">
            Enter the mighty Array: a container for grouping data. Think of Arrays like weekly pill boxes - you know the ones with separate compartments for 'S, M, T, W, T, F'? Arrays are just like that, but instead of the initials of the days of the week marking the contents of a certain compartment, we just use '0, 1, 2, 3, ...' on into infinity (this bears repeating: the first number in an Array index is zero - 1 is second, 2 is third, etc.) Every object in an Array container has a index code - one each, no repeats, no sharing. These indexed 'objects' then can be anything you'd like too: other numbers, names of countries, colors...and...err... other arrays. 
          </p>
          <p class="post">
          That last bit isn't as unintuitive as you think. Once you've organized all that data, you're still likely to have a whole lot of 'potentially-infinitely-large-numerically-indexed-base-zero pill boxes' - you're going to need a way of organizing these too. Say you're putting pills together for different residents at different retirement homes - you don't want the pills for residents at different homes all mixed together. What to do? It's obvious - glue cardboard boxes together to make a really big pill box. You've just made an Array of Arrays! Congratulations!
          </p>
          <p class="post">
          The only problem with this, of course, is that now we'll need to assign a number to each resident, and we'll need a container that indexes names. We'll come back to this in a moment. Let's first turn to that 'aiport code container' example used three paragraphs back (see the last sentence). What use is indexing the alphanumeric codes for airports in an Array? Unless you live in the United States, you're probably not going to be able to divine the fact that 'ORD' represents Chicago O'Hare International Airport from an arbitrarily assigned index number. And if you do live in the U.S., you likely weren't aware that PVG is the airport code for Shanghai's Pudong International Airport. What to do? Enter the mighty Hash. Conceptually, Hash containers (hashes) have a lot in common with arrays: they organize single pieces of information. The big difference, however, is that hashes don't necessarily use numerical indices starting with zero to keep track of that information (the way Arrays do and necessarily must); instead, Hashes can pair the values in question (airport codes) with any other kind of value. In the case of airport codes, the sensible keyword to use in place of a numerical index would clearly be the airport's full name. 
          </p>
          <p class="post">
          So what does this mean for the pharmaceutical supplier for the pill-popping residents of the retirement community? At the highest level, it means the large cardboard-pill-box likely won't be labelled '0, 1, 2, 3' - instead, we would use something like the communties' names (e.g. 'Sunrise Living', 'Blue Lagoon Community', 'Arkham Residential Institute', etc.). And instead of labelling the normal-sized pill boxes contained in each cardboard box, why don't we just label each box with the resident's name? And each of the week's compartents with the standard days of the week? We can even organize the pills scheduled for popping each day, but they can be left in an Array (Hashes can contain other Hashes, and other Arrays, and vice-versa) - we'll just label the pills starting with number 0.
          </p>
          <p class="post">
            Arrays and Hashes are extremely powerful tools for organizing data and can be of huge utility when arranging that information in hierarchical structures. Just remember: do not ingest on an empty stomach or while operating heavy machinery.

          <p class="post">
          Having peer paired on upwards of 15 challenges now, I can comfortably say that this aspect of the Dev Bootcamp experience has been as helpful as the individual reading assignments. Pairing with others to solve challenges - especially as each of my peer pairs to-date has been an unknown entity - has been exhillarating and has forced me to maintain an flexible and open mind. I have learned that the surest way of ensuring a successful pairing session is the same as with any meeting: preparation, preparation, preparation. Versing yourself - even to a cursory extent - in the material that will be covered with your pair ensures that - if your partner has done the same - that you can quickly transition into the core difficulties faced in the challenge. And  - in the case that your pair has not had the opportunity to prepare the challenge - preparation ensures that you will be able to get the session moving quickly and understand the trajectory you and your pair should take to expedite the success of the session.
          </p>
          <p class="post">
          A key to successful pairing session is recognizing - as quickly as possible - how to adapt to the strengths and weaknesses of your pair. If your pair is more attuned to the technical challenges at hand, by all means allow them to take the navigation role and learn at their direction while you drive. Be careful, however, that in the case that your navigator's understanding of the technical challenges and solutions outpaces your own, that you do not allow them to run rampant over you without sufficiently explaining their thought process. Allowing a pair to operate without sufficently conveying their thoughts is a disservice to both yourself (who acquires no new technical knowledge) and your pair (who does not improve his/her commmunications skills).  
          </p>
          <p class="post">
          It is really important to consider the success or failure of a pairing session immediately after the conclusion of the session. While the interaction is still fresh, it will be hugely helpful to take some notes specifying your thoughts on the session and the ways you think you might improve future sessions. If you follow this practice, it is almost guaranteed that you will be able to predict the contents of the feedback from your peers ...and this is a really good thing! The more attuned you are to the way you're affecting your pair's perception of the success or failure of the session, the more easily you'll be able to improve the quality of the pairing and the more easily you'll acheive success with your pair.

            At the heart of programming lies a desire to maximize efficiency and productivity - oftentimes this idea is glibly convoluted with the the "laziness" of programmers and their aversion to repeating a task manually when a program could be written to undertake the repetitious work. Whatever perspective you take on the underlying character of what motivates programmers, the fact is that the concept of 'don't repeat yourself' is so ubiquitous in the world of programming that's it's been attributed it's own respected acronymn: D.R.Y. 
          </p>
          <p class="post">
          This rule manifests itself in many ways and at many levels of programming, but perhaps one of the most structurally important places it appears is in the concept of the 'Class'. Consider the example of an economist hoping to analyze the effects of income inequality on the upward mobility of people in France, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The economist would naturally begin with the acquisition of the infomation needed to conduct this analysis, which on the quantitaive side would consist almost wholly of by-country income and wealth statistics aggregated from individual annual tax returns. Other statistics too - e.g. gross domestic product, trade, balance of payments, mortality rates, etc. - will undoubtedly be indispensable in the analysis of all three countries.  
          </p>
          <p class="post">
          Assuming the definitons for these variables all abide by international standards (as France, the UK, and the US almost always do), and assuming that we are interestied in performing a fair and balanced apples-to-apples comparison of these countries, at this point it would be both a safe and an expedient step for our economist to acknowledge two things: each of the countries in question is an 'Economy', and the state of each 'Economy' is represented by the exact  same variables (or near-enough as makes no practical difference). While perhaps self-evident and intuitive, the recogniton of this fact has importnat implications for the duration of time in which the economist can conduct the analysis, as well as important implications for the structure of a program that may ultimately crunch the numbers and conduct the analysis.
          </p>
          <p class="post">
          In programming this analysis, we would literally define 'Economy' as a "class" which - no matter what economy is in question - can be represented by the ever-present variables mentioned above. In programming parlance, we call these variables "instance variables", because the state (healthy/poor economy, growing/recession economy, booming/depression economy) of every instance of the class 'Economy' (e.g. France, UK, US) will be dependent on the value of these variables (e.g. GDP, inflation, trade flows). Again, while it may seem ridiculous to exclaim over something so self-evident, this truth of classes and the uniformity of characteristics across instances of that class is vital to define. Once that generalized definition establishes that each of the three economies is of a certain class, the programmer is libertated from the repetition of analyzing three economies and instead may focus on creating a single analytical method which can then be applied to any member of the 'Economy' class - that's a reduction in workload of two-thirds!

            So, you've been using .each to iterate through a each element in a collection object. Clever! No doubt you are using some kind of assignment within the code block to develop a new array. That's clever too, because the return value of .each is always to echo back the original collection object. But, what if we wanted to change this? How would would iterate through the each element in the collection object and return a new collection to the method, rather than ultimately echoing the original collection?
          </p>
          <p class="post">
            Enter '.map'. Unlike .each, .map returns a new collection object of the same size as the original and containing the values generated in the code block. Mapping produces a new collection object whose elements correspond to the original collection objects processed through the code block.

          <h1 class="subject" id="c3-thought">The Galaxy of Abstract Sequential Thought</h1>
          <p class="post">
            University of Connecticut Professor Anthony Gregorc has analyzed my brain (indirectly, through his 15 question questionnaire) and informs me (or his questionnaire informs me) that the Star Wars character I most resemble is Obi-Wan Kenobi (the Sir Alec Guiness interpretation). This is because, like me, Ben's preferred method of thought is what Gregorc calls an "abstract sequential". 
          </p>
          <p class="post">
            A quick stream-of-consciousness rundown on the salient points of the process of abstract sequential thinking regularly contains the following gist: analyze before acting; give me macro or give me death; macro to micro; facts (data), facts (data), facts (data); sources, sources, sources; research, research, research; "Shhhh! Quiet please!"; I work alone; there's no crying in baseball. You can take the test for yourself (see Google) and research the methods in more depth if you like, but I won't go into a fuller explanation of my own thinking style beyond this. 
          </p>
          <p class="post">
            Whatever you think of Gregorc's Star Wars quiz (and I must admit that I found a majority of the descriptions he assigns Ben and I to be spot on), the exercise raises an interesting question: assuming that these results are valid, what do they mean? The meaning here that is of most interest is not so much the definition of Abstract Sequential thought, but - in recongniton of this immutable truth of my character and brain - what do they mean for how I can improve my efficiency in thought and collaboration? Gregorc tells us that no thinking styles are better than others, but surely there are things that certain thinking styles are better-suited to than others?
          </p>
          <p class="post">
          Gregorc provides few answers to this question (at least he hasn't posted many online; assumedly becasuse he is possessed of one of the other thinking styles and thus hasn't created a cheeky blog post addressing the question). Gregorc does, however, provide numerous examples of tasks and situations in which Ben and I would find ourselves agitated (which I will not legitimize by listing here). Yet, if my thinking style is immutable, it seems that striving to address these "shortcomings" would be completely futile. So, rather than embark on a self-critical examination, I will briefly outline three ideas for increasing efficiency in thought for myself and young impressionable Abstract Sequential thinkers searching for a sensei. I will call this section:

          </p>  
          <p class="post">
          RESEARCH. There's a whole lot of noise out there drowning the signal - and there is no where that this is truer than on the internet. Find reliable sources (e.g. statistics providers, full transcripts, books) and consume as many of them as you can. One will always lead to another -bibliographies are a great place to look. Repitition and discipline in this practice will expand your mental vision and lead to much wider understanding. 
          </p>
          <p class="post">
          FOCUS. “For the ordinary man, whose mind is a checkerboard of crisscrossing reflections, opinions and prejudices, bare attention is virtually impossible. His life is thus centered not in reality itself, but in his ideas of it.” (- Roshi Philip Kapleau, The Three Pillars of Zen) Don't fall into this trap. The more you focus, the easier and more enjoyable it will become.
          </p>
          <p class="post">
          PICK A FIGHT. Push others to have conversations on large abstract questions and challenge them to truly explain what they are thinking and why they think that way. Then go read and research some more to understand the issue given the new perspectives you've encountered. If you disagree, and you've researched the sources that support your opinion, start playacting debate club; go and research how you could - if you were forced - take the opposing side of the argument. When you've done this, you'll really be on the way to understanding the issue.

          <p class="post">
              When writing a webpage in HTML, it is vital to understand the "Box Model". The fancy name and the aura of mystery that surround this concept may make the idea seem unapproachable at first, but with a little bit of straight talk and simple visualization, you'll be on your way to working with this core concept in no time.
          </p>
          <p class="post">
              Think of the very edge of your webpage as a large rectangular canvas. Everything you see on your webpage must go on the canvas, and everything that makes it onto the final painting - be it text, photos, icons, etc. - everything is contained within smaller rectangles that fit on the canvas. These smaller boxes can hug the very edes of the text and may be invisible, but even when you can't see them, trust me - they're there. 
          </p>
          <p class="post">
              Whether you can see these rectangles (whether they have a color or an outline), is dependent on how you define these boxes, and there are really only three things that you need to worry about defining when you're first starting out: Margin, Border, and Padding. Let's go back to our canvas now and smack in the middle, we're going to start painting: to be precise, I want you to paint an image of a framed photograph. What are the different things you'll need to paint? Obviously, you'll need to paint the frame - will it be a thick frame? What color will the frame be? We will also need to paint the photo: will it be one of those frames where there is a plain white buffer inside the frame between the frame and the photo? Will the photo go to the edges of the frame?
          </p>
          <p class="post">
              Objects inside the Box Model are just like that: the objects in your webpage are all just painting of framed objects (a moment ago that object was a photograph, but it could also be text, a paragraph of text, a movie, viewer, etc.). The only difference is that in HTML we don't call the frames "frames", we call them "borders"; and we don't call that buffer zone between the frame and the object it frames a "buffer", we call it "Padding". You'll be wondering about that last term I haven't mentioned, "Margin", and this is essentially the same idea as padding, except whereas padding is defined as the space between the frame and what is inside the frame, "margins" are just the space between the edges of the frame and anything else that is painted on the larger canvas. We could leave 5 inches between the border (or the frame) and everything else on the canvas, and that would be us defining "margin" as "5 inches". Although we don't use inches to meaure space, we use screen pixels, which is written as "px".
          </p>
          <p class="post">
              Now remember - all the borders (or all the frames) must be in the shape of a rectangle. And, as you'll remember, every rectangle has four sides. Now, since webpages are only viewed one way (or at least they normally aren't viewed upside down), we define those four sides very sensibly: top, right, bottom, and left - and we always talk about them in that order. We can define them all at once (e.g. margin: 5px) or define them each individually (e.g border-left: 20px).
          </p>
          <img id="img_frame" src="../frame.png" alt="">
          <p class="post">
            This is a real picture frame. Do you see the frame? That's our "Border" - we can make it as thick or thin as we want; we can make it dashed or solid; we can make it any color in the spectrum of light. Do you see the off-white buffer? That's our "Padding" - again, we can make it as thick or thin as we want (it can be 0px or 100px). That white space in the middle would be our object, but we'll leave that discussion for a different time. Do you see the space between the edge of the border and the text above it? That's our margin - and here again, we can make it as large are small as we want. Suffice it to say, that everything on your webpage - everything - has one of these, whether you see it or not! Here are a few more examples, and the code that defines each:
          </p>
          <img id="img_frame" src="../3boxes.png" alt="">
          <p class="post">
            Let's start with Box 1. The black "border" is 10px thick on all sides. You can see that there's no space between the border and the yellow contents, which means that the padding is 0px all the way around. But what about the margin? The margin between the top of the Box 1 object box is much larger than the margin on the right side, that is, the margin separating Box 1 from Box 2. Box 2's black border is much thicker (30px to be exact) and it has a large white padding space (50px) between the border and the yellow object. Box 3 is almost the same as Box 2, but the big difference is that margins - the margin between the edge of the Box 3 frame and the other boxes is much larger than that between Box 1 and Box 2. Further the margin between the Box 3 frame and this paragraph is much larger than between the last paragraph and Box 2.

              The Shanghai Metro is the world’s largest metro system, comprised of 270 trains (1,490 cars) servicing 282 stations across 420km (260mi) of track. Each day, 6.5mn passengers (equivalent to the combined populations of Los Angeles and Chicago) walk into 600 Metro entrances and pay RMB20mn (US$3.2mn) to pass through 1,700 ticket gates, traverse 35 interchanges, and board 12 subway lines.

          <p class="post">

              At 0610 China Standard Time (CST), I am among them, awaiting the Line 9 eastbound express from Dapuqiao to the Lujiazui financial district. Backlit advertisements smile from the walls and ceilings are hung with televisions blaring Propaganda Department-approved news stories. As a train arrives and the doors open, the queue surges forward. Forced past disembarking passengers, I squeeze in amongst the crush and brace as the doors close and the train jolts forward. My fellow sardines are an assorted crowd: some sleep, some stare out windows, and others make idle conversation. A majority of the passengers stare into glowing cellphones: they watch American sitcoms, Korean soap-operas, and Japanese anime; they play videogames, cut fruit with katanas, slingshot birds, and drive racecars; they post on Weibo, flirt on Momo, and text on WeChat.
          </p>
          <p class="post">

              As myriad distractions inundate the train car, I am struck by how willingly passengers abandon the train’s reality and ride abstract non-sequiturs to their destinations. For my part, the 2,700 seconds between my apartment and office constitutes 5% of my workday: I check the day’s schedule, index my priorities, peruse overnight market news, reply to client requests, and email my mother.

              “For the ordinary man, whose mind is a checkerboard of crisscrossing reflections, opinions and prejudices, bare attention is virtually impossible. His life is thus centered not in reality itself, but in his ideas of it.”
          </p>

          </p>
          <p class="post">

              What matters most to me is mindfulness of the present moment – I lament minutes lost in frivolous pursuits or squandered on meaningless distractions. Time is in short supply, and every moment is an opportunity warranting attention.
          </p>
          <p class="post">

              By 0700 CST, I am in the office and 7% into my workday. When maintenance priorities (editing products, updating data, and drafting commentary) are complete, I focus my attention on the more expansive challenge of China macroeconomics. My approach to quantitative analysis of the world’s second largest economy (2011 GDP: US$7.3trn) involves an immense volume of data (8.6GB) drawn from hundreds of sources (statistics bureaus, market information services, commodity traders, purchasing managers, etc.) illustrating a seemingly endless number of variables (bilateral trade flows, investment volumes, consumer price indices, currency movements, commodity prices, interbank offering rates, loan volumes, etc.). Mindfulness affords me the mental strength and clarity of thought required to envision the behavior, interactions, and implications of these variables; it defines my purpose when collating legions of numbers into informative models and anchors my assumptions when conducting scenario analyses.
          </p>
          <p class="post">

              At 2000 CST, just 50,400 moments after it began, my workday is done and I am again aboard the Shanghai Metro. My commute home is reserved for calling or corresponding with my girlfriend, Anya, my cherished family (2 parents, 2 sisters, 1 grandmother, 2 godchildren, 25 cousins, 8 uncles, 8 aunts) and close friends (former colleagues, college roommates, high school classmates). Christenings, birthdays, graduations, and weddings are all celebrated and enjoyed in the company of my fellow commuters. As the second-eldest of my cousins, I find college counseling, internship advice, interview preparation, and career guidance are increasingly outsourced to my China mobile. Mindfulness enables me to appreciate the truly important relationships and events in my life – even when they occur 17 time zones away – and helps me address the variables of highest import in my personal life.
          </p>
          <p class="post">

              My day is no more demanding than many others, but mindfulness helps me appreciate each moment in my life, both individually and in aggregate. These moments have taught me the value of my own mind and the value of trusting my own thoughts and actions. Adam Smith was right:
          </p>
          <p class="post">

              “The advantage which is gained by saving the time commonly lost in passing from one sort of work to another, is much greater than we should at first view be apt to imagine it.”

          <p class="post">
              The mindfulness techniques touched upon this week were especially interesting. I have been a disciple of the 'Miracle of Mindfulness' for several years now, and I find effective employment of mind-management leads to high quality work and minimizes my stress levels. Mindfulness also gives me the confidence that when tackling an especially difficult task, I am not only acheiving the nominal goal of compeleting the task, but also capturing the real benefit of focusing my mind on a difficult challenge and - when the challenge is overcome - expanding both my ability and my self-confidence in my mind's ability to grow and improve.
          </p>
          <p class="post">
              Mindfulness is a strange creature: like a Mandelbrot set, there are universes within universes on until infinity. The catalyst for my initial foray into mindfulness was my recognition that, "There aren't enough hours in the day." I actually found myself half-jokingly telling a manager this exact thing once in an annual review. I've learned that our minds don't come with 'factory-settings' that can't be changed; they are amazing tools, but they require constant training and attention. I really find it fascinating that so few of us spend time thinking about thinking.
          </p>
          <p class="post">
              Preparation is certainly the first part of my plan for Phase 0; that includes not just scheduling, but also utilizing my 'free-time' to expand my hacking ability beyond those skills explicity addressed in the Phase 0 curriculum. Beyond this, I suppose my time management plan can be summarized in two words: focus and attention.

              Version control is system of recording and tracking changes to document or repository of documents. It enables multiple parties to collaborate on the development of a single document or repo without fear that different parties will create incompatible branches of the target document.

              Git is a version control system enabling software engineers and other parties to collaborate on a single distributed document (e.g. code base, text document) without fear that changes will be lost in the process of swapping versions among project collaborators. Git tracks changes (both the changes themselves and the author of the changes) and ensures all involved parties are both informed of changes and operating on the most current version of a document. There are redundancies to ensure that any changes made to a master file are legitimate (i.e. pull requests), and functionality for reverting to a previous version of document.

              Github is remote repository of the git version control system which enables users in disparate locations to collaborate on projects using Git. User profiles, users public repositories, and user activity are available for viewing by the GitHub community.

          <p class="post">
              Developers use version control for a number of reasons:
              1) To prevent development of incompatible branches of the target document or code
              2) To track changes and enable retroactive assessment of changes
