          <p class="post">
              The Shanghai Metro is the world’s largest metro system, comprised of 270 trains (1,490 cars) servicing 282 stations across 420km (260mi) of track. Each day, 6.5mn passengers (equivalent to the combined populations of Los Angeles and Chicago) walk into 600 Metro entrances and pay RMB20mn (US$3.2mn) to pass through 1,700 ticket gates, traverse 35 interchanges, and board 12 subway lines.

              At 0610 China Standard Time (CST), I am among them, awaiting the Line 9 eastbound express from Dapuqiao to the Lujiazui financial district. Backlit advertisements smile from the walls and ceilings are hung with televisions blaring Propaganda Department-approved news stories. As a train arrives and the doors open, the queue surges forward. Forced past disembarking passengers, I squeeze in amongst the crush and brace as the doors close and the train jolts forward. My fellow sardines are an assorted crowd: some sleep, some stare out windows, and others make idle conversation. A majority of the passengers stare into glowing cellphones: they watch American sitcoms, Korean soap-operas, and Japanese anime; they play videogames, cut fruit with katanas, slingshot birds, and drive racecars; they post on Weibo, flirt on Momo, and text on WeChat.
          </p>
          <p class="post">

              As myriad distractions inundate the train car, I am struck by how willingly passengers abandon the train’s reality and ride abstract non-sequiturs to their destinations. For my part, the 2,700 seconds between my apartment and office constitutes 5% of my workday: I check the day’s schedule, index my priorities, peruse overnight market news, reply to client requests, and email my mother.

              Observing my fellow passengers, I am often reminded of a Buddhist teaching on meditation:
          </p>
          <p class="post">

              “For the ordinary man, whose mind is a checkerboard of crisscrossing reflections, opinions and prejudices, bare attention is virtually impossible. His life is thus centered not in reality itself, but in his ideas of it.”
          </p>
          <p class="post">

          </p>
          <p class="post">

              What matters most to me is mindfulness of the present moment – I lament minutes lost in frivolous pursuits or squandered on meaningless distractions. Time is in short supply, and every moment is an opportunity warranting attention.
          </p>
          <p class="post">

              By 0700 CST, I am in the office and 7% into my workday. When maintenance priorities (editing products, updating data, and drafting commentary) are complete, I focus my attention on the more expansive challenge of China macroeconomics. My approach to quantitative analysis of the world’s second largest economy (2011 GDP: US$7.3trn) involves an immense volume of data (8.6GB) drawn from hundreds of sources (statistics bureaus, market information services, commodity traders, purchasing managers, etc.) illustrating a seemingly endless number of variables (bilateral trade flows, investment volumes, consumer price indices, currency movements, commodity prices, interbank offering rates, loan volumes, etc.). Mindfulness affords me the mental strength and clarity of thought required to envision the behavior, interactions, and implications of these variables; it defines my purpose when collating legions of numbers into informative models and anchors my assumptions when conducting scenario analyses.

              At 2000 CST, just 50,400 moments after it began, my workday is done and I am again aboard the Shanghai Metro. My commute home is reserved for calling or corresponding with my girlfriend, Anya, my cherished family (2 parents, 2 sisters, 1 grandmother, 2 godchildren, 25 cousins, 8 uncles, 8 aunts) and close friends (former colleagues, college roommates, high school classmates). Christenings, birthdays, graduations, and weddings are all celebrated and enjoyed in the company of my fellow commuters. As the second-eldest of my cousins, I find college counseling, internship advice, interview preparation, and career guidance are increasingly outsourced to my China mobile. Mindfulness enables me to appreciate the truly important relationships and events in my life – even when they occur 17 time zones away – and helps me address the variables of highest import in my personal life.

              My day is no more demanding than many others, but mindfulness helps me appreciate each moment in my life, both individually and in aggregate. These moments have taught me the value of my own mind and the value of trusting my own thoughts and actions. Adam Smith was right:

              “The advantage which is gained by saving the time commonly lost in passing from one sort of work to another, is much greater than we should at first view be apt to imagine it.”

          <p class="post">
              The mindfulness techniques touched upon this week were especially interesting. I have been a disciple of the 'Miracle of Mindfulness' for several years now, and I find effective employment of mind-management leads to high quality work and minimizes my stress levels. Mindfulness also gives me the confidence that when tackling an especially difficult task, I am not only acheiving the nominal goal of compeleting the task, but also capturing the real benefit of focusing my mind on a difficult challenge and - when the challenge is overcome - expanding both my ability and my self-confidence in my mind's ability to grow and improve.
          </p>
          <p class="post">
              Mindfulness is a strange creature: like a Mandelbrot set, there are universes within universes on until infinity. The catalyst for my initial foray into mindfulness was my recognition that, "There aren't enough hours in the day." I actually found myself half-jokingly telling a manager this exact thing once in an annual review. I've learned that our minds don't come with 'factory-settings' that can't be changed; they are amazing tools, but they require constant training and attention. I really find it fascinating that so few of us spend time thinking about thinking.
          </p>
          <p class="post">
              Preparation is certainly the first part of my plan for Phase 0; that includes not just scheduling, but also utilizing my 'free-time' to expand my hacking ability beyond those skills explicity addressed in the Phase 0 curriculum. Beyond this, I suppose my time management plan can be summarized in two words: focus and attention.

              Version control is system of recording and tracking changes to document or repository of documents. It enables multiple parties to collaborate on the development of a single document or repo without fear that different parties will create incompatible branches of the target document.
          </p>
          <p class="post">
              Git is a version control system enabling software engineers and other parties to collaborate on a single distributed document (e.g. code base, text document) without fear that changes will be lost in the process of swapping versions among project collaborators. Git tracks changes (both the changes themselves and the author of the changes) and ensures all involved parties are both informed of changes and operating on the most current version of a document. There are redundancies to ensure that any changes made to a master file are legitimate (i.e. pull requests), and functionality for reverting to a previous version of document.
          </p>
          <p class="post">
              Github is remote repository of the git version control system which enables users in disparate locations to collaborate on projects using Git. User profiles, users public repositories, and user activity are available for viewing by the GitHub community.
          </p>
          <p class="post">
              Developers use version control for a number of reasons:
              1) To prevent development of incompatible branches of the target document or code
              2) To track changes and enable retroactive assessment of changes
              3) To collaborate with numerous involved parties in potentially widely dispersed geographic locations
