  <h1>P0U1W1: The Week in Review</h1>
  <h4>14 December 2014</h4>

      The mindfulness techniques touched upon this week were especially interesting. I have been a disciple of the 'Miracle of Mindfulness' for several years now, and I find effective employment of mind-management leads to high quality work and minimizes my stress levels. Mindfulness also gives me the confidence that when tackling an especially difficult task, I am not only acheiving the nominal goal of compeleting the task, but also capturing the real benefit of focusing my mind on a difficult challenge and - when the challenge is overcome - expanding both my ability and my self-confidence in my mind's ability to grow and improve.

        Mindfulness is a strange creature: like a Mandelbrot set, there are universes within universes on until infinity. The catalyst for my initial foray into mindfulness was my recognition that, "There aren't enough hours in the day." I actually found myself half-jokingly telling a manager this exact thing once in an annual review. I've learned that our minds don't come with 'factory-settings' that can't be changed; they are amazing tools, but they require constant training and attention. I really find it fascinating that so few of us spend time thinking about thinking.

        Preparation is certainly the first part of my plan for Phase 0; that includes not just scheduling, but also utilizing my 'free-time' to expand my hacking ability beyond those skills explicity addressed in the Phase 0 curriculum. Beyond this, I suppose my time management plan can be summarized in two words: focus and attention.
