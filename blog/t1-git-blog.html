  <h1>P0U1W1: The Week in Review</h1>
  <h4>14 December 2014</h4>

      The mindfulness techniques touched upon this week were especially interesting. I have been a disciple of the 'Miracle of Mindfulness' for several years now, and I find effective employment of mind-management leads to high quality work and minimizes my stress levels. Mindfulness also gives me the confidence that when tackling an especially difficult task, I am not only acheiving the nominal goal of compeleting the task, but also capturing the real benefit of focusing my mind on a difficult challenge and - when the challenge is overcome - expanding both my ability and my self-confidence in my mind's ability to grow and improve.

        Mindfulness is a strange creature: like a Mandelbrot set, there are universes within universes on until infinity. The catalyst for my initial foray into mindfulness was my recognition that, "There aren't enough hours in the day." I actually found myself half-jokingly telling a manager this exact thing once in an annual review. I've learned that our minds don't come with 'factory-settings' that can't be changed; they are amazing tools, but they require constant training and attention. I really find it fascinating that so few of us spend time thinking about thinking.

        Preparation is certainly the first part of my plan for Phase 0; that includes not just scheduling, but also utilizing my 'free-time' to expand my hacking ability beyond those skills explicity addressed in the Phase 0 curriculum. Beyond this, I suppose my time management plan can be summarized in two words: focus and attention.

Version control is system of recording and tracking changes to document or repository of documents. It enables multiple parties to collaborate on the development of a single document or repo without fear that different parties will create incompatible branches of the target document.

Git is a version control system enabling software engineers and other parties to collaborate on a single distributed document (e.g. code base, text document) without fear that changes will be lost in the process of swapping versions among project collaborators. Git tracks changes (both the changes themselves and the author of the changes) and ensures all involved parties are both informed of changes and operating on the most current version of a document. There are redundancies to ensure that any changes made to a master file are legitimate (i.e. pull requests), and functionality for reverting to a previous version of document.

    <p>
  Github is remote repository of the git version control system which enables users in disparate locations to collaborate on projects using Git. User profiles, users public repositories, and user activity are available for viewing by the GitHub community.
    </p>
    <p>
    Developers use version control for a number of reasons:
    1) To prevent development of incompatible branches of the target document or code
    2) To track changes and enable retroactive assessment of changes
    3) To collaborate with numerous involved parties in potentially widely dispersed geographic locations
